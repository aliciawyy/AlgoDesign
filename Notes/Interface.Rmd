# Interface

An __interface__ provides a specification rather than an implementation for its members.

* Interface members are all _implicitly abstract_.
* A class can inherit from only a _single_ class but can implement _multiple_ interfaces.

An interface can contain only methods, properties, events and indexers. (non data fields)

Interface members are always implicitly public and cannot declare an access modifier. Implementing an interface means providing a __public__ implementation for all its members.

An interface object can be cast to any class which implements that interface.
