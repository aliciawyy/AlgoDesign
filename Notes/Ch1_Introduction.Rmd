Chapter 1 Introducting C# and the .Net Framework
================================================

C# is a general-purpose, type-safe, object-oriented programming language.

The object-orientation paradigm includes

* __Encapsulation__ means creating a boundary around an object to separate its external (public) beharvior from its internal (private) implementation details.
* __Inheritance__
* __Polymorphism__

The distinctive features of C# from an object-oriented perspective are

* _Unified type system_ : C# has a unified type system, where all types ultimately share a common base type. (e.g. `ToString` method.)

    _Type_ is the fundamental building block in C# = an encapsulated unit of data and functions.
  
* _Classes and interfaces_ : An interface only _describes_ members and the implementation for those members comes from types that implement the interface.

* _Properties, methods and events_ can all be function members.
